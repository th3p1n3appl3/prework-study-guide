# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a Prework Study Guide designed to keep all notes taken during my edX Front-End developer bootcamp course.

My motivation behind this project was to organise my notes effectively and to be able to revise easily.
It is, therefore, a project that helped me learn and grow as a developer but also a place to revisit core knowledge.
The main problems solved included the implementation of HTML, CSS and JavaScript elements in the project.
A variety of different techniques used to design and create a website now belong to my skillset.
